# Code Documentation

Code will be documented with Latex where possible, however contributers are welcome to use their formats
as long as it falls into our acceptable list:
<ul>
<li>Latex</li>
<li>md</li>
<li>powerpoint</li>
</ul>
If your documentation falls out of date, please update or delete it. Misleading documentation is worse than none.

<h1> General Guidelines </h1>
Documentation should be concise.
